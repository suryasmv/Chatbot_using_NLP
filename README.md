# NLP-Based Chatbot

## Introduction

Welcome to the NLP-Based Chatbot project! This project showcases how Natural Language Processing (NLP) can be used to build a chatbot that understands and responds to user inputs. Using TensorFlow and the NLTK library, this chatbot can interpret and answer queries in a meaningful way.

## Features

- **NLP Integration:** The chatbot uses NLP techniques to tokenize, stem, and classify user inputs.
- **Intent Recognition:** The chatbot identifies the user's intent and provides an appropriate response.
- **Scalable Design:** The project is built with a flexible design that allows for easy expansion of intents and responses.
- **Interactive Responses:** Based on the identified intent, the chatbot selects and returns a random appropriate response.

## Tech Stack

- **Programming Language:** Python
- **Libraries:** NLTK, TensorFlow, NumPy, Keras
- **Tools:** Google Colab, JSON

## How It Works

The chatbot is built using the following steps:

1. **Data Preparation:**
   - Load intents from a JSON file containing different user intents and their associated responses.
   - Tokenize and stem the text data to create a bag of words that the model can use.

2. **Model Training:**
   - A TensorFlow neural network is trained using the processed text data.
   - The model learns to classify user inputs into specific intents based on the training data.

3. **Response Generation:**
   - When a user input is received, it is processed similarly to the training data.
   - The trained model predicts the most likely intent.
   - A response corresponding to the predicted intent is selected and returned.
